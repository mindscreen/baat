With BAAT you can perform automated accessibility testing as a bookmarklet or user script in your browser.
It allows accessibility tests to be performed even in situations where the installation of additional software or plug-ins is not possible.

You can simply use axe-core or create your custom rulesets based on axe-core.
## Features
- Provides automated accessibility checks for websites.
- Uses axe-core for quick and precise analysis.
- Can be run as a bookmarklet or userscript.
- Suitable for any organization dedicated to accessible website development.

## Usage

There are two ways to install and use BAAT:

### Usage as a bookmarklet
1. Head to the [BAAT GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mindscreen/baat/releases/latest).
2. Download the baat-bookmark.txt file.
3. Go to the bookmark management of your browser and import the bookmark from this file.
   [Guideline for Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-html-file), [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en) (use the "Bookmarks HTML file" option for import), [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/move-internet-explorer-favorites-to-a-new-pc-a03f02c7-e0b9-5d8b-1857-51dd70954e47#ID0EDF)
4. You need to activate the bookmark toolbar. If the BAAT bookmarklet is not already in the bookmark toolbar, move it there.
5. Activate the bookmarklet on any page. (The bookmarklet tries to load the axe.min.js rules file from jsdeliver into BAAT, if this does not work (e.g. due to CSP restrictions) you can provide a local version of the rules file in the settings)
6. Press the play button in the top bar of BAAT to run the tests.

### Usage as an userscript
1. Install an userscript manager, such as Tampermonkey. You will find installation instructions on the [Tampermonkey website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Head to the [BAAT GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mindscreen/baat/releases/latest).
3. Download the userscript.js file.
4. Install the Userscript using your userscript manager.
5. Run the userscript on any page. (The userscript tries to load the axe.min.js rules file from jsdeliver into BAAT, if this does not work (e.g. due to CSP restrictions) you can provide a local version of the rules file in the settings)
6. Press the play button in the top bar of BAAT to run the tests.


### Options

#### Issue Impact Filters

The Issue Impact filters control which issues are shown in the results. The default is to show only serious or critical issues.

#### Developer mode

The developer mode is an advanced mode of BAAT. 
It will display the results of the axe-core test in a more detailed way. 
This is useful for developers who want to see the exact error messages.
It will also print some more debug info into the console.

## Troubleshooting
### Content Security Policies (CSP)
Some websites use Content Security Policies (CSP) to restrict the execution of third-party scripts. If a website has a CSP that blocks the execution of third-party scripts, BAAT may not work as expected.

If you encounter issues with BAAT not running on a website, it's possible that the website has a CSP that blocks the execution of third-party scripts. In this case, you may need to contact the website administrator to request that they whitelist BAAT in their CSP.

## Building BAAT yourself
Bookmarklet for running axe-core tests directly in the Browser

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Build BAAT with `npm run build`

The primary color of the application is controlled by the following environment variables:

- `THEME_PRIMARY` (default: `#d32228`)
- `THEME_PRIMARY_LIGHT` (default: `#7e1317`)
- `THEME_PRIMARY_DARK` (default: `#ed4047`)

## Creating a new Rule
BAAT allows you to run custom versions of axe-core. This way you can add your own rules to the test.
To do so, you need to create a fork of the [axe-core repository](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and [add your own rules](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-development.md).
After running `npm run build` in the root repository of the root folder of axe-core, you will find a file called `axe.min.js` in the root folder. This file contains your custom rules and can be used with BAAT.
