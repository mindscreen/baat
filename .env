SETTINGS_INFORMATION="<h2>BAAT</h2><div role='doc-subtitle'>Bookmarklet Accessibility Audit Tool v{window[baatSymbol].version}</div><p>BAAT is a tool for running automatic accessibility testing scripts directly in the browser and inspecting the results.</p><p>To be able to run BAAT you have to select a minified axe-core script. A copy can be obtained by compiling the source files available at the <a href='https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core'>axe-core GitHub Page</a>.</p><p>A word of caution. Since BAAT modifies the DOM it is generally recommended to reload the page before testing manually.</p>"
